#Major 
 - NetClient implementation
    - Add simple socket library
 - Sample client for C++ using socket
 - More primitives
    - Circle
    - Rectangle
    - Line
 - Adding and rendering all those primitives in scene
 - Readme
 - Contribution guide - how to write clients
 - Documentation how to extend 
 
#Minor
 - Score table
 - Camera mouse drag navigation and zoom to point
 - Primitives:
     - Round textures for units, to distinguish by type
     - Draw hp bars
     - Draw cooldown (maybe another line under hp bar)
 - Textured playback buttons
 - Layout controlling - choose which primitives to draw
 - Popup when click on unit (show detailed info)
 - Window icon, bump glfw to 3.2
 - Use CMake for loading 3rdparties
 - Add glm to 3rdparties
 - Add glfw to 3rdparties (maybe using git submodule)
 - Text rendering (Hack ImGui or whatever)
 - Using truetype in UI
 - Docked layout, draw visualization to separate window using Framebuffer
 
#Features
 - Minimap
 - Config file with specification where to find textures and so on (use same ini as ImGui)
 - Save windows closing state to ini file
 - Grass texture for whole scene
 
#Future development
 - Integration to strategy code
 - Add debug button and interaction with stategy
 - Skybox
