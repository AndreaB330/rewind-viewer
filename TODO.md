## Major 
 - [x] NetListener implementation
    - [x] Add simple socket library
    - [ ] Ability to reconnect
    - [ ] No drops because of fragmentation (Improve simple socket or implement your own) 
 - [x] Sample client for C++ using socket
 - [ ] More primitives
    - [x] Circle
    - [ ] Rectangle
    - [ ] Line
 - [ ] Adding and rendering all those primitives in scene
 - [ ] Readme
 - [ ] Contribution guide - how to write clients
 - [ ] Documentation how to extend 
 
## Minor
 - [ ] Score table
 - [ ] Orthographic projection, remove Camera
 - [ ] Camera mouse drag navigation and zoom to point
 - [ ] Primitives:
     - [ ] Round textures for units, to distinguish by type
     - [ ] Draw hp bars
     - [ ] Draw cooldown (maybe another line under hp bar)
 - [ ] Textured playback buttons
 - [ ] Layout controlling - choose which primitives to draw
 - [ ] Popup when click on unit (show detailed info)
 - [ ] Window icon, bump glfw to 3.2
 - [ ] Use CMake for loading 3rdparties
 - [ ] Add glm to 3rdparties
 - [ ] Add glfw to 3rdparties (maybe using git submodule)
 - [ ] Text rendering (Hack ImGui or whatever)
 - [ ] Using truetype in UI
 - [ ] Docked layout, draw visualization to separate window using Framebuffer
 
## Features
 - [ ] Minimap
 - [ ] Config file with specification where to find textures and so on (use same ini as ImGui)
 - [ ] Save windows closing state to ini file
 - [ ] Grass texture for whole scene
 
## Future development
 - Integration to strategy code
 - Add debug button and interaction with stategy
 - Skybox
